# .NET Core Dependency Injection Object Lifetime
In .NET Core, you can register dependencies using three different methods AddSingleton, AddTransient, and AddScoped. 
This blog explains each of these methods.

Objects injected using Dependency Injection have a specific lifetime. Object's lifetime depends on how you register dependency. 
To understand how each method is different from than others we will create a console application, and service and inject this service 
to application middleware.
